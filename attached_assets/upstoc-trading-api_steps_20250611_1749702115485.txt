1. Define Your Requirements
Data to Display:
Account balances
Open trades (with P&L metrics)
Closed trades (historical)
Status of modules (data fetching, strategy trigger, execution)
Actions:
Operate/trigger modules from the dashboard
View logs/errors
Platforms:
Web (single page app)
Mobile (Android/iOS)

2. Design Your Architecture
Backend
Responsibilities:
Fetch/store balances, trades, and module statuses
Expose REST or WebSocket APIs for the frontend/mobile apps
Handle authentication
Tech Choices:
Node.js (Express, NestJS)
Database: PostgreSQL
Frontend
Web:
React.js (with Material UI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI)
Mobile:
React Native (cross-platform, shares code with React web)

3. Start with a Web Dashboard 
Step-by-Step:
Backend API
Set up a REST API (e.g., with FastAPI or Express)
Endpoints:
/balances
/trades/open
/trades/closed
/modules/status
/modules/trigger (for actions)
Connect to your trading data sources and modules
Frontend Web App
Scaffold a React app (npx create-react-app dashboard)
Create pages/components:
Dashboard: Overview of balances, open/closed trades
Module Status: Show status, allow triggering actions
Trade Details: Drill-down into trades
Use charts (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js) for P&L visualization
Authentication
Implement JWT or session-based auth in backend and frontend
Real-Time Updates (Optional)
Use WebSockets or polling for live updates (e.g., open trades, module status)

4. Expand to Mobile
React Native: You can reuse much of your React web code
Flutter: Write a new app, but can share backend
API: Mobile app consumes the same backend API

5. DevOps & Deployment
Backend: Deploy on cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.)
Frontend: Host on Vercel, Netlify, or your own server
Mobile: Publish to Play Store and App Store

6. Monitoring & Logging
Add logging to backend for module status and errors
Optionally, display logs/errors in the dashboard

Summary Roadmap
Design your data models and API
Build the backend (API + DB)
Build the web dashboard
Integrate with your trading modules
Add authentication
(Optional) Add real-time features
Expand to mobile app
